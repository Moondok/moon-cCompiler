## moon-cC : a toy compiler with dual backends
### Brief intro
This is a toy C compiler .It can transform a subset of ```C language``` into ```Mips``` assembly.
The C language standard is [here](https://www.quut.com/c/ANSI-C-grammar-y-1999.html#labeled-statement), it can also be found in our ```src``` folder.

### features
Our compiler supports a subset of ```C language```.It supports two data types: ```int``` and ```float``` for now. Besides , it supports arrays and function invoke.

### to-be-done
We do not implement ```pointer``` in this version.
